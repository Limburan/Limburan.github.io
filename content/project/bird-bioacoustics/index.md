During my postdoc I was part of an NCN-funded project *Interspecific competition for acoustic space in birds* led by Dr Micha≈Ç Budka at the Department of Behavioural Ecology, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland.

We used passive acoustic monitoring and playback experiments to investigate strategies used by forest bird communities to minimise competition for acoustic space.
